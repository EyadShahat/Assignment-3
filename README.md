# 📘 Assignment 3 – Advanced Portfolio Website

## 📄 Assignment Description  
This project is the third upgrade of my personal portfolio website, building on Assignments 1 and 2.  
In this phase, I implemented **advanced functionality**, including external API integration, complex logic, improved state management, and performance enhancements.  
The goal was to create a dynamic, interactive, and professional-quality web application that demonstrates strong JavaScript and modern web-development skills.
